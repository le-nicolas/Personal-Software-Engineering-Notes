One-to-many Relations

	- Use `ForeignKey`

	- Related name makes it so that when you want to access an authors book set (by default RELATEDCLASSNAME_SET [book_set]) you use the provided related name 'books' instead of the default 'book_set'.

```class Books
    author = models.ForeignKey(Author, on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True, related_name='books') # Can be null if no value is provided
```

Many-to-many Relations
    
	- Use `ManyToManyField`

```
# In this case, related_name is used to get all the books of a country by using 'books' (in this case) instead of 'book_set'
class Book
    published_countries = models.ManyToManyField(Country, related_name='books')
```

One-to-One Relations    
    
	- Use `OneToOneField`

	- Related name is not needed here since Django automatically will link authors to the Address object it belongs to. This means you can access an author object from its adress like 'Address.objects.all()[0].author'

```
class Author
    address = models.OneToOneField(Address, on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True)
```
