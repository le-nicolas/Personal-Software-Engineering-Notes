3D models
	• Simple rocket body ( cylinder and cone)
	• Egg ( sphere with egg material)
	• Parachute ( hidden at first, then unfolds with animation or scaling)
	• Fins ( extra meshes that helps with physics stabilization)

Physics setup:
	• Add rigidbody to the rocket and egg
	• Rocket gets an upward thrust force at launch
	• Drag increases dramatically when the parachute opens ( simulate air resistance)
	• Landing uses spring/damper physics ( like a car suspension) on the fins

Parachute deployment logic:
	• Detect apex of the flight ( vertical velocity near 0)
	• Or after a certain time since launch, trigger parachute opening.
	• Increase the drag coefficient of the rocket once the parachute is deployed.

Egg safety system:
	• Monitor the relativeVelocity on collision
	• If the impact force > threshold ( e.g. 10 m/s downward), then declare the egg cracked.

Landing mechanism:
	• Upon landing, detect how much the rocket tilts or bounces
	• Have stability

Phase 1: Unity Editor and project setup
	Create a new 3D project and establish a clean folder structure ( Assets, Scenes, Scripts, Prefabs). Hands-on work in the scene and hierarchy windows set the stage: 
		Ø Place a flat ground plane ( with a collider and basic material) to define the world, add default lighting. 
		Ø Create primitive shapes ( cylinders, cubes) and group them into a simple rocket and group them into a simple rocket GameObject
		Ø Then convert it into a Prefab for easy reuse.
		Ø Layers and tags are defined ( rocket, payload, ground) and the physics collision matrix is configured, preemptively preparing for later collision filtering. 
		Ø Thus, this phase emphasizes organization - consistent naming, nesting objects, and using prefabs so that complex systems to come remain manageable.
		Ø Lighting and environment: set up a simple skybox or background. Place a directional light ( sun) or point lights. Ensure the scene is visually clear. This is not for final art quality, but to avoid confusion during testing.
	Healthy note: Assigning RocketLayer to a parent GameObject ( Rocket group). You may want all child objects ( nose, body, fins) to share the same layer . . . For consistent collision behavior, physics filtering, and layer-based effects.
	
	This will ensure collision matrix rules apply uniformly to entire rocket
		Useful for raycasting, trigger zones, and script filtering ( like LayerMask)
		
		Prevent unexpected bugs from some parts being on Default while others are on RocketLayer. If and only if any child object needs a different layer, you can manually change that afterward.
		
		Set-up physics collision matrix
			This preps your scene for advanced control like detecting only certain impacts or preventing self-collisions
			
Phase 2: Core Physics - Rigidbodies and colliders ( physics engine)
	With the scene in place, we now then attach rigidbody components to objects to enable physics simulation: adjusting Mass, Drag, and Angular Drag to see how motion changes. Add various Collider types ( box, sphere, capsule, mesh) to objects: eg. BoxCollider on the ground and MeshColliders on rocket fins ( switching to convex if needed for dynamic objects). 
	
	Rigid bodies - allow the object to fall under gravity, and affected by forces, collisions, and drag.
			a. Mass = affects inertia, momentum, collisions
			b. Drag = Resists linear motion ( air resistance )
			c. Angular Drag = Resists rotation
				1) Make mass realistic and try different drag values to see changes in fall rate and spin.
		
		• Very good if experiment with gravity and observe default behavior: dropping objects to watch acceleration. 
		• Grasp the fixed physics timestep: physics update occur in FixedUpdate(), moving objects via script ( using forces) must be coded
			§ Update() = every frame, variable timing. Which is use for UI, input, animation
			§ FixedUpdate() = every fixed time step ( a default of 0.02s), physics and rigidbody motion
				□ This one is a physics simulation like falling, bouncing, collisions, needs consistent timing to stay stable and accurate but Unity runs physics ata fixed rate by default: 50 times per second
					® e.g. pushing a ball forward with physics, use AddForce(). But if you put addforce in update instead, it may get unevent ( this breaks the physics realism!); moving the object ignoring gravity, collisions, friction ) this is teleporting!
						◊ Thus, if you push, drop, bounce, fly, roll = FixedUpdate() + Rigidbody
		• Physics materials are friction and bounciness on the ground or payload to control how objects rebound.  e.g. basic falling-object demo and understanding of simulation about rigidbody motion in 3D.
			§ Rigidbody Basics: attach a rigid body to an object ( rocket body, payload, egg).
				□ Explore properties: set mass ( heavier or lighter), enable use Gravity, tweak linear and angular Drag. Observe how high vs low drag changes falling speed and rotation damping.
			§ Colliders: add colliders matching object shapes. 
				□ For the rocket body, use a capsule or mesh collider 
				□ For fins use box colliders
				□ Ensure the ground plane has a collider ( either set to static or kinematic Rigidbody so it doesn’t fall). 
				□ Learn about Trigger vs Collision modes 
					® Use non-trigger colliders for physical contact
					® Test by dropping a sphere onto the ground - notice the collision events.
			§ Physics timestep: The physics runs on a fixed timestep ( 0.02s default). 
				□ In a simple script, move an object by AddForce inside FixedUpdate() to apply continuous push. 
				□ Compare this to moving transform position in Update() (which ignores physics) 
					® See that AddForce leads to smoother, framerate-independent motion
			§ Gravity and motion: a default gravity of ( - 9.81 m/s^2). Optionally adjust global gravity project settings > physics. Drop objects of different mass; 
				□ Note: in Unity's physics (ideal world) mass doesn’t affect gravity acceleration
			§ Physics materials: the creation of PhysicsMaterial Assets ( e.g. bouncy, frictionless) apply  bouncy material to a ball and a bumpy one to the ground. 
				□ We can now drop the ball and see it bounce. Which shows how material properties affect collision responses
	
Phase 3: Advanced Rigidbody Control - Forces, Torque, And Collision Modes
	This phase delves into controlling rigidbodies via forces and torques. A script dynamic behavior of "Rigidbody.AddForce() to propel objects. With the experimentation of different ForceMode options: e.g. applying an Impulse for an instant burst ( an explosion effect) vs a continuous Force for steady acceleration. Angular motion is covered via AddTorque(): - e.g. spinning a rocket on its axis or imparting a tilt. 
	
	Manipulate the rigidbody's center of mass and inertia tensor to make rotation behave realistically ( e.g. altering where the rocket will tip). Collision detection modes introduced: switching high-speed objects to Continuous Dynamic mode to prevent "tunneling" through colliders. This phase also includes using OnCollisionEnter/Exit callbacks to read collision data. e.g., capturing the collision impulse or relative velocity when two objects hit. This sets up understanding of impact forces before we simulate egg-breaks
		
		• Applying forces: a script to apply AddForce(Vecotor3.up * thrust) during launch. Try different ForceModes: with Force, watch gradual acceleration; with Impulse, see an immediate jump. Use a loop or keypress to trigger force for a few frames, simulating a short rocket burn. 
		• Adding Torque: applying AddTorque(Vector3.forward * torqueAmount) to rotate objects. Which creates an in-game "control stick" script that lets you roll or putch the rocket with torque. Therefore, demonstrating angular drag effects.
		• Force modes: experiment with ForceMode.Acceleration ( ignoring mass) vs ForceMode.VelocityChange ( instant velocity change). Note how heavy vs light objects respond. Emphasize choosing the right mode for realistic physics or gameplay feel.
		• Collision detection modes: For fast-moving objects like projectiles, switch Rigidbody collision detection to Continuous or Continuous dynamic. Observe how this stops objects from clipping through walls at high speed. This is important for high speed rocket.
		• Collision data: use OnCollisionEnter(Collision coll) in scripts. Log coll.relativeVelocity and coll.impulse to analyze impact strength. For example, drop an egg onto a rigid floor and read the collision impulse. This teaches how to quantify collision force, a prelude to damage thresholds
		• Center of Mass Adjustments: Modify the Rigidbody's center of mass in code ( via an attached helper object) to alter how the rocket pitches. e.g. move COM below center to make it more stable. Show that an off-center COM causes torque when thrusters fire
	
Phase 4: Joints and Mechanical Constraints
	Mechanically connect objects using Unity's joint components. Which includes adding a SpringJoint to simulate elastic connections ( useful for tethering a parachute to the rocket or creating a soft landing cable), a HingeJoint to allow rotation around one axis ( useful for rocket fins, door, or a simple launch rail pivot), and a FixedJoint to rigidly attach objects ( e.g. holding the egg payload to the rocket until release). ---- advance topics are ArticulationBody(for multi-link chains), which can be used for precise motion of connected parts. Each joint properties - anchors, axis, spring/damper settings that are manipulated to see how they affect motion.  Therefore this phase can implement e.g. a springy tether; attach one end to the rocket, another to a parachute object, set the spring strength and rest length to simulate slack/taut behavior during descent.
		• SpringJoint: between two objects. Set the spring stiffness and damping to make the parachute bob lightly. Adjust the restLength so the parachute hands below the rocket. See how the spring stretches ad pulls back.
		• HingeJoint: attached to the rocket for movable fins or a cap. Configure the joint's axis and anchor ( e.g. cube door that swings open). Explore motor and limits on the hinge to drive rotation or restrict angle. Useful for controlled fin release
		• FixedJoint: to glue the egg payload to the rocket body. At launch, the egg stays rigidly attached ( FixedJoint). Later, the joint can be broken to simulate release. Test breaking by increasing breakForce or disabling the joint in script.
		• ArticulationBody: a sequenced stage deployment for multi-link kinematic chains
		• ConfigurableJoint: for full freedom in constraints. 
		• Joint Exercises: attach the rocket to a launch rail using a spring or hinge so it can pivot but return to center. Experiment until comfortable with joint tuning

Phase 5: Collision Detection and Impact Analysis
	The understanding of collisions and their consequences. Refine collision detection: setting up the Collision Matrix - only meaningful collisions register ( e.g. ignore collisions between rocket fins). Test high-speed impacts using continuous collision modes. Scripts use OnCollisionEnter and OnTriggerEnter to log contact points and impulses. e.g. launching a weighted payload into the ground. Which calculate impact forces ( impulse / Time.fixedDeltaTime ) and relate that to damage potential. This leads to setting a clear " impact threshold ": a numeric value above which an object like the egg should break. Students also explore Physics.IgnoreCollision to temporarily disable collision ( useful for ignoring the egg's collider while it's inside the rocket). By phase end, this can distinguish gentle landings ( no break ) from harsh crashes ( breaking the object) based on collision data.
		• Collision modes: Review Discrete vs Continuous. Test a fast-moving object at various speeds and collision settings, ensuring it collides reliably.
		• Filtering collisions: use layers from Phase 1 (disable collisions between specified layers), e.g. disable Rocket-Rocket and Egg-Rocket initially if needed.
		• Collision Callbacks: In script, use void OnCollisionEnter(Collision collision) and examine collision.contacts and collision.relativeVelocity. Calculate approximate force: e.g. float impactForce = rb.mass * collision.relativeVelocity.magnitude
		• Impact threshold: Define a damage threshold ( for the egg ). In a test scene, drop the egg from various heights onto a rigid floor. Use OnCollisionEnter to measure and record impact forces. Which it could determine a threshold value let's say 50N-s above which to consider the egg cracked.
		• Triggers vs colliders: Decide which collisions should use triggers. e.g. a trigger zone at the landing pad might indicate touchdown without physical force ( trigger just signals "landed" event). The use of OnTriggerEnter(Collider other) for non-physical events.
		• Physics.IgnoreCollision: Demonstrate disabling collisions between two colliders at runtime. For instance, when the rocket separates from a part, ignore collision briefly to prevent interference. This technique prevents unwanted interactions ( eg. Egg colliding with the rocket walls after being released)
	
Phase 6: aerodynamics - Drag and Parachute Simulation
	Simulating air resistance and parachute physics. First, adjust the Linear drag and Angular Drag on the rocket's Rigidbody to mimic aerodynamic drag. Observe how high drag slows descent dramatically. For more realism, implement custom drag: scripting a force opposite to velocity ( F = -k * v * |v|) to simulate quadratic air drag. Next, design a parachute: attach a lightweight canopy object ( e.g. semi-sphere or cloth) to the rocket with a SpringJoint. The canopy's Rigidbody gets very high drag, so when deployed it slows the assembly. Optional . . . . Unity's Cloth component can be used for visual realism and attached to a ring of colliders or a SpringJoint to the payload. Finetune parachute parameters: the effective surface area ( via drag value), spring rest length ( how far it hangs), and activation mechanics. This will create a convincing parachute effect through physics, which will prepare for the actual deployment logic.
		• Rigidbody Drag: set the rocket's Linear Drag to a moderate value ( e.g 0.5) and Angular Drag as well. In play mode, let the rocket fall ( no thrust) and observer slower terminal velocity. Then try a very high drag ( e.g. 10 ) to approximate an open parachute.
		• Custom drag script: in a script's FixedUpdate(), apply rigidbody.AddForce( -0.5 * airDensity * dragCoefficient * area * v*v * v.normalized). This more accurately simulates drag ∝ v². use a public variable for dragCoefficient and adjust until the motion looks natural.
		• Creating a Parachute Object: model or import a simple parachute canopy. Attach a Rigidbody ( set mass small, high drag) |shit? Unity3D is just what I do  dafuk, this is easy| and multiple ropes ( SpringJoints) to the rocket. Alternatively, create four SpringJoints from four canopy points to the rocket to simulate cords. Adjust spring constants for a realistic sag :))))
		• Parachute Activation: Initially keep the parachute disabled or retracted. Plan that in the next 2 phases we trigger the activation. But put an option to manually enable it in the editor mid-flight to see how it slows the rocket. Adjust the combined system mass and drag so that deployment gives a gentle descent
		• Wind zones ( optional ): Still depends on time, place a wind zone in the scene to blow on the parachute for added effect, showing advanced awareness of environment forces.
	
	
Phase 7: Particle systems and visual effects
	This creates a particle system at the rocket nozzle to simulate water thrust: configure the emission rate and shape ( downward cone) and set Start speed/lifetime to mimic a jet of water. Color over Lifetime and size variations can make the particles fade into mist, and collision modules can let them bounce off the ground to simulate splashes. One can put an optional trail effect or smoke particle can follow the rocket to emphasize motion. Add particle effects for impact: a small dust burst when landing or a burst of fragments if it breaks. Thus, the visual effects to simulation events and how particle modules ( velocity, size, color, emission bursts) work. The particle systems are driven by script or timeline e.g. emission starts when thrust begins and stops at burnout.
		• Thrust Effect: Create a particle system as a child of the rocket's nozzle. Set Shape to cone (angle ~15 degrees), Emission to a burst or high rate while thrusters run. In Velocity over Lifetime, push particles downward fast. Use Color over Lifetime to start blue-ish (which is the water) and fade to transparent. Tweak Size over Lifetime so particles expand/smoke. Play and adjust until the visual matches a powerful water jet.
		• Engine Exhaust vs water: if simulating steam or exhaust, add another system with gray smoke, lower velocity and longer lifetime with a slight upward drift. Use blending to mix with the water spray.
		• Parachute effect: this is optional but attach subtle particles ( like drifting particles) to the parachute cords to show airflow.
		• Ground Impact: Create a particle prefab to ground impact - e.g. burst of dust or pebbles. In the rocket's collision script (phase 5), spawn this prefab when the rocket with the egg hits the ground hard.
		• Egg Break Visual: if the egg breaks, trigger a particle effect of small shard or white fluid spray. Use ParticleSystem.Emit() in script to produce a quick burst on collision.
		• Optimizing Particles: Turn off Play on awake initially and controlling particles via script ( e.g. particleSystem.Play() on launch). Also adjust the Max Particles and Simulation Speed for performance.
	
Phase 8: Scripting Architecture and Best Practices
	The key is organizing script s for maintainability and clarity. The MonoBehaviour lifecycle: Awake() and Start() for initialization, Update() for per-frame logic, FixedUpdate() for physics. This phase will introduce to divide functionality. . . . Eg. A RoketController handles thrust and flight state, a ParachuteController manages chute behavior, and a UIManager updates the HUD. Set up a State Machine (using enums or a pattern) for  flight phases: e.g. Idle, Launching, Coasting, ParachuteDeployed, Landed. Events and delegates are heavily used: which is the OnLaunch event when the rocket takes off, which multiple scripts can subscribe to ( start particle emission, enable physics, hide input UI). Best practices are emphasized: avoid large monolithic scripts; use ScriptableObjects or config files to store parameters ( so that thrust curves, drag coefficients, and egg-damage thresholds can be tweaked without rewriting code). Coroutines are used for timed sequences ( such as counting down to launch or running the burn for a fixed duration). Architecture should be modular, clean folders, descriptive script names, clear input/output for each system
		• MonoBehaviour Lifecycle: To fruition this project, create a sample script that print messages in Awake(), Start(), Update(), and FixedUpdate(). Observe the order of calls. Understand that physics code ( e.g applying force) belongs in FixedUpdate(), while input reading can be in Update().
		• Flight State Machine: Define an enum FlightState { Idle, Thrusting, Coasting, Parachuting, Landed }. In RocketController, use a switch-case or state pattern to handle logic for each state. e.g in Thrusting state continuously apply AddForce until time runs out, then switch to Coasting. Thus, organizing the main game loop
		• Events and Delegates: In a GameEvents static class, declare C# events like public static event Action OnLaunch; . From the input script ( e.g. on spacebar press), invoke OnLaunch() . Other scripts (particles, audio, UI) subscribe to GameEvents.OnLaunch += StartThrust; so they all react simultaneously. This decouples systems. Also demonstrate using UnityEvent for the same concept via the inspector if preferred.
		• Script Organization: Store all scripts in a scripts folder, grouped by function ( e.g. controllers, managers, systems). Keep each MonoBehaviour focused: one for movement, one for collision handling, one for UI updates.
		• Configuration Data: Create a ScriptableObject class RocketConfic holding parameters: e.g. float thrustPower; float fuelMass; AnimationCurve thrustCurve; . In the Inspector, tweak these without changing code. Similarly, EggConfig can hold breakThreshold.
		• Coroutines: use Ienumerator methods for timed actions. E.g. on launch, StartCorouting(BurnThrust( duration )); which applies force each yield return new WaitForFixedUpdate() . Or a coroutine to wait until altitude reaches > X then call parachute. This avoides tracking timers manually.
		• Refactoring and Maintenance: keep the codebase ready for adding features like variable rocket design.
	
Phase 9: Parachute Deployment Logic and Egg Damage Systems
	For the parachute, script the automatic deployment triggers. The common logic will be to detect the rocket's apex: in FixedUpdate(), check when Rigidbody.velocity.y changes from positive to negative ( or use a simple state with if ( velocityY <= 0 && state == thrusting) ). Alternatively, use an altitude trigger: when transform.position.y drops below a preset threshold. OR another option will be a timer or fuel depletion event to open the parachute. ---> once triggered, the ParachuteController runs: enabling the parachute object, attaching it and increasing drag. For the egg payload, we use the collision analysis from phase 5. the egg is a Rigidbody with a collider; on collision with the ground, the script checks collision.impulse . If it exceeds the damage threshold, the egg is "broken": swap the intact egg model with a shattered-version prefab or spawn fragment pieces. In either case, an OnEggBroken event fires to update UI ( failure ). If below threshold, the egg survives ( SUCCESS! ). All this ties into the flight state machine: transitioning to a landed or success state. This phase will connect the physics to gameplay outcome.
		• Apex Detection: in the RocketController script, store the last vertical velocity each frame. When previousVelocityY > 0 && currentVelocityY <= 0 , detect apex.
		Which will immediately switch state to Parachuting and invoke parachute logic. Then use a small downward velocty threshold ( e.g. -0.1 ) to avoid noise.
		• Altitude or Time Backup: as redundancy, check if transform.position.y falls below a certain altitude without a chute deployed; if so, force deploy. Or after a maximum flight time ( in case of a glitch). Keep these values configurable in the inspector.
		• Parachute Activation: On deploy, enable the parachute GameObject ( if initially disabled) or instantiate it as a child of the rocket. If using joints from phase 6, ensure the SpringJoints are active ( OR connect new joints now). Increase the rocket's drag ( or rely on the parachute's high drag) so descent slows. Optionally play a sound or animation of the parachute unfurling.
		• Egg Attachment: Initially, attach the egg to the rocket's bottom via a FixedJoint or parent-child transform. The ehh follows the rocket exactly. Once the chute is opened ( or at safe point), optionally break the attachment so the egg falls beneath the rocket ( if modeling a drop). If the egg is meant to stay inside, keep it attached but still allow it to collide for damage.
		• Collision and Damage: in the egg's script, use OnCollisionEnet(Collision coll). If coll.gameObject is the ground or any solid object, compute impactForce =  coll.impulse.magnitude / Time.fixedDeltaTime . If impactForce > eggBreakThreshold , then break the egg: destroy the intact egg model and instantiate a "broken" egg prefab with a few pieces (or play an explosion particle). Set a flag or state to record failure. If below threshold, mark success.
		• Event Handling: when the egg breaks or lands safely, trigger events ( e.g. OnEggCrash or OnEggSafe ). Subscribe a UIManager or GameManager to these events to update the HUD (display "Egg Survived!" or "Egg Crushed!") and stop the simulation
		• Edge cases: add checks so that the egg only breaks once (disable collision script after first collision) and that the parachute only deploys once. Use bool flags like isParachutOpen and hasLanded ot prevent repeated triggers.

Phase 10: Full Integration - Game Loop, UI, and Camera Systems
	Create a Game Loop: define states from pre-launch ( show controls ) through launch, powered ascent, coasting, parachute descent, and landing. e.g. pressing a launch button or key transitions from Idle or Thrusting. The RocketController script manages state transitions based on events and timing established earlier. Simultaneously, a GameManager might oversee the overall sequence and handle scene transitions.
	
	UI - design a HUD that displays real-time data: altitude ( using transform.position.y), vertical speed, and egg status (intact/broken). Sliders or input fields can allow us to set launch parameters ( nozzle pressure or angle). The UI listens to game events ( like rocket launch or landing) to show or hide panels ( show a results panel with a success or fail message after landing)
	
	Camera systems are set up for dramatic viewing: a Chase Camera ( using Cinemachine or a scripted follow) keeps the rocket in view through flight, smoothly adjusting to its motion. After landing, the camera might cut to a fixed overview or zoom in on the egg.  One can also organzie a scene -> Main menu ( choose rocket settings), a simulation scene ( active flight), and a results scene. Use a SceneManager.LoadScene() to switch. Test and polish the simulation: balancing rocket parameters ( mass, thrust curve, drag) for realism, ensuring performance ( minimizing update load, using fixedupdate for all physics), and cleaning up unused objects. Thus giving you: 1. Launch mechanics, 2. Physics-accurate flight, 3. parachute deployment, 4. egg survival check, 5. user interface.
		• Game loop implementation: in the GameManager or RocketController, finalize the flight state machine. On launch input, move to Thrustin ( start particle effects and add force); after fuel/time ends, go to Coasting; upon apex detect, go to Parachuting; upon ground contact, go to landed. Each transition may trigger UI updates or sound cues.
		• Scene and Object Setup: Ensure the rocket prefab ( with all required scripts and components) is placed in the launch scene. Place the ground and any obstacles. If using multiple scenes, set up a simple main menu to load the launch scene.
		• UI integration: Create Canvas elements: text for altitude (update every frame with transform.position.y.ToString("F1")), for vertical velocity, and for parachute status (“Open”/“Closed”). Add an indicator for egg integrity. Hook UI buttons: e.g. a “Launch” button calls the launch method, a “Reset” button reloads the scene. Link these via the Inspector or through event subscriptions.
		• Camera Setup: 
		Add a Cinemachine Virtual Camera or write a camera follow script: position the camera behind and above the rocket, interpolating (lerping) its position each frame to smoothly track. You can also allow a free-look camera or fixed angles. Test that the rocket remains in view from launch through landing.
		• Scoring and Results: In the Landed state, evaluate if the egg survived. If success, display a “Success” panel; if broken, display “Mission Failed”. You may also calculate distance traveled or max height and show as a score. Use a UI panel or overlay image for the end screen.
		• Final Testing: Perform full test flights. Tweak physics values: the thrust duration vs. mass for a realistic arc, parachute drag for a gentle descent, and egg threshold for a fair challenge. Fix bugs (e.g. ensure no null references, that joints don’t explode on extreme forces). Optionally build the project (PC or WebGL) to ensure everything works outside the editor.
		• Polish: Add small touches as time allows: sound effects for launch and parachute, screen shake on heavy impact, a skybox, and shadows for depth. Comment final code and clean up the project structure. By completion, the course has guided learners from zero to a professional-grade Unity simulation system.
