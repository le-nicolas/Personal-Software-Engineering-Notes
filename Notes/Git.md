Connecting a new PC to your GitHub profile

1. Generate a token using the instructions from [Creating a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens):
  	 - GitHub profile -> Settings -> Developer Settings -> Personal access tokens

2. Open your git bash and set up the token using the following commands:

    ```bash
    git config --global credential.https://github.username <your_username>
    git config --global credential.https://github.com.token <your_token>
    ```

REMEMBER: Don't forget to set the token's permissions, even for public repositories!

Removing a file added with `git add`

Just use `git reset <file>` and the file will be removed from the current index (the "about to be committed" list) without changing anything else.

To unstage all files from the current stage set use `git reset`

Ignoring a previously tracked file

`.gitignore` will prevent untracked files from being added (without an add -f) to the set of files tracked by Git. However, Git will continue to track any files that are already being tracked.

To stop tracking a file, we must remove it from the index:

```bash
git rm --cached <file>
```

To remove a folder and all files in the folder recursively:

```bash
git rm -r --cached <folder>
```

The removal of the file from the head revision will happen on the next commit.

WARNING: While this will not remove the physical file from your local machine, it will remove the files from other developers' machines on their next git pull.
