Docker - A valuable skill, as it is a widely used tool in the software development industry, not just in robotics.

##  Remove All Stopped Containers

To clean up your Docker environment and remove all stopped containers, run:

```
$ docker container prune
WARNING! This will remove all stopped containers.
Are you sure you want to continue? [y/N] y
Deleted Containers:

ghi789jkl012 
```


## ðŸ“¦ Delete Dangling (Unused) Images

Remove dangling (untagged) Docker images:

```
$ docker image prune
WARNING! This will remove all dangling images.
Are you sure you want to continue? [y/N] y
Deleted Images:
sha256:abc123...
sha256:def456...
```


``` $ docker image prune -a ```
WARNING! This will remove all images not used by any containers.

# Bonus tips!

```
$ docker system df
sample output will be
